Paper.js is an open source vector graphics framework that runs on HTML5 Canvas. It offers a clean DOM and a lot of powerful functionality to create and work with vector graphics.

This example of code is useful as it is interactive and could be used to represent a multitude of things. You could use this to represent sound, movement, vibration, etc.

To use Paperjs, you must first install it using NPM (npm install paper). It is important to place the folder globally so you can use it for different examples.  You must then create a Github Repository, create an HTML file and a JavaScript file. In the HTML file, you must connect the example you want to edit with the correct paper.js library (example: paper.full.js) as well as the correct paperscript tag (type=”text/paperscript”). PaperJS offers tutorials and examples of how you can update your code through the link http://paperjs.org/tutorials/.
