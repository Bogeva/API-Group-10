This project is called Rounded Rectangles and is edited by Klara.

Rounded Rectangles is a fun representation of shapes, movement and color. It is based on a seven layered object, every layer has its own color. Each time the user clicks their mouse seven more layers are added to the stack. When the user moves their mouse the stack follows its movements. The user also interacts with the object by changing speed, degree of rotation, border radius of the square and the points of the star, using the sliders/checkbox.
