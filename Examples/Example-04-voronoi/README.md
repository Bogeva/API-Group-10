This project is called Voronoi and has been edited by Diana. 

This PaperJS example is using paper methods to adjust columns and rows that create interactive cells. These cells change depending on the functions and events written. 

This example of code is useful as it is interactive and could be used to represent a multitude of things. You could use this in a prototype to represent sound, movement, vibration, etc. 
 
For this example specifically, you need to include the link to the example javascript file:
	<script type="text/javascript" src="/Examples/Example-04-voronoi/rhill-voronoi-core.js"></script>

This is not required in all paperjs examples, so you must look at the source code on paperjs.org/examples in order to confirm if it has been added there.
