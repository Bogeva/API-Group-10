This project is called Rounded Rectangles and is edited by Klara.

Rounded Rectangles consists of a seven layered square, every square has its own color. Each time the user clicks their mouse seven more layers are added. When the user moves their mouse the stack is displayed from the side, following the movement of the mouse. The user also interacts with the project by changing the speed, the degree of rotation and the border radius of the squares. STAR?

The project is a fun representation of movement and color, being able to see the stack of squares from different angles.
