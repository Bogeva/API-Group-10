This project is called ”Future Splash” and has been edited by Lin. 

To use this project the user has to move the mouse around, this will make the fish and the waves move. On click, a sound has been added. The user has to wait for the sound to stop, before being able to repeat it. 

Some of the code in this project has been borrowed from example one “Meta Balls. 

This example can be used to prototype a game.
